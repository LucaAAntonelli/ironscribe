# IronScribe
A server-client application for ebook syncing and management written in Rust


# Tasks
- [ ] Look into a hybrid server that exposes gRPC and REST, as REST is better usable on the web
- [ ] Create different components
    - [ ] Folder sync
    - [ ] Client/Web GUI
        - [ ] Add/Edit/Remove books
        - [ ] SQL database
        - [ ] Book metadata
    - [ ] Analytics

# Current Problems:
- The `Book` struct defined in `shared.rs` kind of duplicates the equally named struct generated by tonic -> See if the definition can simply be omitted and replaced with an import of the generated one.
- `axum::Server` doesn't exist. It's unclear what it's supposed to reference.
- Some trait bound for the REST API's getter function is not satisfied. Apparently, there are some extra debug options for axum -> look into it
